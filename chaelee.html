        <p>
            Chaelee is a graduate student at UMSI. She is taking the UX Research and Design track.
            She is very new to html and is still learning everying you can do with it. She is also
            learning python3, which she is also new to, in another class.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a student, she hopes to learn how to develop a website for reasons of personal artistic
            expression. She also might persue web development in the future but is still figuring out what
            she wants to do.
